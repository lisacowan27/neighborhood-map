# Lisa's Neighborhood Map

To view the map and explore the highlighted places, install all of the files in the archive into a directory on your harddrive. It is self-contained. Once your have done so, double click the index.html file to open it in a browser and begin.

To view information about a location, click on the name in the list, or click on a map marker. A Google Map InfoWindow will popup and show you the name of the place, an original photograph of it, and give you a link to Wikipedia with more information about it. You can also use the input box above the list to filter the place names.

## The Upper Peninsula

The Upper Peninsula of Michigan is one of the most beautiful and isolated places in the United States. I used original photography rather than Google StreetView images because they did not do the individual locations justice. I hope you learn a little bit about a magical place.
